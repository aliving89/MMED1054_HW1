            <p>Hello World, <br> My name is Andrew, and I come to you with over 10 years of Community Pharmacy and Customer Service experience. I previously attended Fanshawe College for both the Pharmacy Technician and Human Resources Management programs - I plan to combine all of my passions into a job in the online health space.
            <br>I come from a small town in Northern Ontario, but have called London, Ontario home for almost 12 years! In my spare time, I enjoy baking bread and an assortment of desserts. I can also be found playing with my 3 year old Shiloh Shepherd puppy named Appa.</p>
